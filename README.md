To create a standalone executable file that can be run on any computer without the need for a Python interpreter, you can use a tool like PyInstaller. PyInstaller allows you to package your Python code and its dependencies into a single executable file.


Here are the steps to create a standalone executable using PyInstaller:


### Install PyInstaller by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

### pip install pyinstaller
Create a Python script, for example, data_processing.py, with your code inside.

### Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your data_processing.py script is located.

### Run the following command to create the standalone executable:

### pyinstaller --onefile data_processing.py
This command will create a dist directory in the current directory, and inside that directory, you will find the standalone executable file.

Copy the standalone executable file to any computer where you want to run it, even without a Python interpreter installed.

Run the standalone executable on the computer, and it will execute your code without the need for a Python interpreter.


Please note that PyInstaller creates an executable specific to the operating system you are using. So, if you want to create executables for different operating systems, you will need to run PyInstaller on each respective operating system.


Additionally, the size of the standalone executable file can be larger compared to the original Python script because it includes the Python interpreter and other dependencies.
